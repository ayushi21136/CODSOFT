# CODSOFT
I had the incredible opportunity to intern at CodSoft as a Data Science Intern . CodSoft is a leading technology company specializing in software solutions for data analytics and business intelligence.
The Techniques I Acquired During This Period Included:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Classification Metrics (Accuracy Score, Precision ,F1-Score , Recall, Confusion Matrix)
Regression Metrics (Mean Squared Error, R-squared)
Additional Methods such as Normalization, Oversampling and Undersampling.

Initially, I found myself unsure of the specific requirements for these projects. To bridge this knowledge gap, I turned to YouTube to gain a foundational understanding of the tasks at hand. I learned about various machine learning techniques essential for constructing predictive models. Subsequently, I dedicated myself to studying these techniques, focusing on their relevance to the assigned projects.
Skill Enhancement:
The internship provided an excellent platform for enhancing technical and soft skills:
Programming Languages: Strengthened my proficiency in Python and gained experience in using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning.
Collaboration: Worked closely with cross-functional teams, enhancing my ability to communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
Problem Solving: Faced and resolved challenges related to data quality, model accuracy, and optimization, fostering a problem-solving mindset.
CONCLUSION:
I successfully completed three tasks set by CodSoft. The sequential projects – Titanic Survival Prediction, Movie Rating Prediction, and Credit Card Fraud Detection – allowed me to explore deeper into different aspects of data science. This experience not only equipped me with the practical knowledge needed to build models but also imparted valuable insights into project management and presentation. 
I am grateful to CodSoft for providing me with this invaluable opportunity to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. This virtual internship has equipped me with practical experience and the confidence to tackle data science challenges in the future. The journey at CodSoft has been a remarkable stepping stone in my data science career, and I am excited to continue exploring this fascinating field.
